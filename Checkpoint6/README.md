### [Part A - Basic Connectivity - Linux VMs Firewall Setting](#part-a---basic-connectivity---linux-vms-firewall-setting)

1. Run a command in `LR-xx` that show `iptables` chains. What is the default setting? How could you improve these settings to be less vulnerable to attacks?
2. Run a command that shows the hostname in `LR-XX` and `LX-XX` and embed the output in your submission.
3. Submit your `lr_iptables.txt` and `ls_iptables.txt` files. **Do not** embed them in your `README.md`, just add it in your folder and give a hyperlink.
4. Test your firewall settings and your configurations for basic `ssh` and `rdp` connectivity between your Desktop Client and Linux Server `LS-xx` and Windows Server `WS-xx` a few times.


### [Part B - Azure Cost Analysis Charts](#part-b---azure-cost-analysis-charts)


1. Follow the instructions and create a Cost Analysis table similar to sample given to you and embed it in your submission. **Do not put it in separate file, add it to your README.md, but you can keep images in a separate folder. It makes your folder clean and more accessible**
2. Embed a screenshot of your Customized dashboard after finishing this assignment. It must show there all VMs or disks are deleted.
